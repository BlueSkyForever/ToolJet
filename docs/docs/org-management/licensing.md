## Setting up for Licensing

This comprehensive guide aims to assist you in the process of configuring paid plans on your self-hosted platform. We offer three different licenses tailored to your specific requirements. Let's explore how to get the most out of ToolJet's powerful features! üöÄ

Let's look into three types of licenses:

1. **Trial License**: This is a free license that grants access to premium features for a 14-day trial period.

- **New Users**: Select the 14-day trial option during the onboarding process.
- **Existing Users**: If eligible, a start trial banner will be visible on your ToolJet dashboard.

2. **Business License**: This is a paid license that you can purchase **[directly](https://www.tooljet.com/pricing)**.
3. **Enterprise License**: This is a paid license with customizable options. To obtain this license, you have to contact our sales team.

## Updating To Trial License (For Existing Users)

If you are an existing user and wish to update to trial license, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired Workspace.
2. If you are not currently on a paid plan and have not yet used your free trial, you will see a **Start Trial** banner within the ToolJet dashboard. Click on the **Start free trial** button inside this banner to initiate your 14-day trial.

:::caution Note
The trial license key will be valid for 14 days. To fully enjoy ToolJet, we recommend upgrading to premium plans within this period. If you wish to upgrade from the trial to the business or enterprise edition, you can click the **Upgrade or Renew** button or contact our team via **[Slack](https://tooljet.com/slack)**. Upon expiration, access to premium features like OpenID SSO login and Audit logs will be restricted, ensuring no data loss occurs. However, don't worry! You can still upgrade to any of our premium plans and enjoy the benefits of ToolJet.

- Trial licenses are valid for 14 days.
- Business licenses are valid for 3 months.
- Enterprise licenses can be customized to suit your needs.

### 3) What happens if my license expires?

If your business or enterprise license key expires, your instance will revert to operating as a free plan. While you can still create unlimited apps, workspaces, and add users, premium features such as OpenID and Audit logs will no longer be accessible.

### 4) How can I add more users?

There are different methods to do this:

**a)** You can renew directly using the **[business plan](https://www.tooljet.com/pricing)**. (Note: Please do check the list of premium features available with this plan)

### Adding Users on the Business Plan

Your Business Plan subscription cost is based on the total number of builder and viewer seats allocated to your account. You may choose between annual or monthly billing cycles.

## Seat Pricing

**Annual Billing**

- Builder Seat: $24 per month
- End User Seat: $8 per month

**Monthly Billing**

- Builder Seat: $30 per month
- End User Seat: $10 per month

**Pro-rated Charges for Added Seats**

You only pay for the portion of the service you actually utilize, rather than being charged a full amount for a seat you might only use for a few days. If you add extra builder or viewer seats mid-cycle, charges are calculated proportionally. The cost is adjusted for the remaining days within your current billing period (monthly or annual).

Example: If you add a builder seat halfway through your monthly billing cycle, you will be charged $15 for the remaining portion of that month. Starting with your next billing cycle, you will be charged the full monthly rate ($30) for the added builder seat.

**_Lastly, please keep in mind that your license key is private and strictly prohibited from being shared with any third parties._**
